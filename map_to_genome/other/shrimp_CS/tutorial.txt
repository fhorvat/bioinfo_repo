01_shrimpCS_genome_index.pbs.sh
- creates genome index for mapping
- not obligatory, but it speeds up mapping

02_convert_reads_solid2fastq.pbs.sh 
- takes separate sequence (csfasta.gz) and quality (qual.gz)
files and unites them in one fastq-like file
- fastq output is still in color-space, does not covert reads to letter-space

03_shrimpCS_fastq_SE.pbs.sh
- maps reads in colorspace to genome index
- output is .sam, it converts it to .bam, sorts and indexes it
- creates .bigWig coverage
